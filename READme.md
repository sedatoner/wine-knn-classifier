	This project implements kNN algorithm from scratch on UCI Wine dataset to classify wines and achieves 94.44% accuracy with different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan).

	k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm is a simple yet effective machine learning classification method that determines the class of a data point by majority voting of its 'k' nearest neighbors in labeled training data.

	This project includes data visualization, normalization, model performance analysis steps.
